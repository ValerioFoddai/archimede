# [DEPRECATED] Bank Account Integration Plan

> **Note**: This document is deprecated as of January 2024. The bank account functionality has been removed in favor of a new Assets section that will provide more comprehensive asset management features in the future.

## Current Status

The bank account integration has been removed from the system:
- Bank account column removed from transaction list
- Bank account selection removed from transaction form
- Bank accounts page replaced with Assets placeholder
- Database tables cleaned up:
  * Dropped transaction_bank_accounts table
  * Dropped user_bank_status view
  * Preserved user_bank_accounts table for future use

## Future Direction

The functionality previously planned for bank accounts will be reimagined as part of a broader Assets management feature set that will include:
- Multiple asset type tracking
- Investment monitoring
- Performance analytics
- Comprehensive reporting

For current implementation details of the Assets section, refer to the [Features Changelog](./features-changelog.md#assets-section-updates-january-2024).
